# Changelog

Notable changes to openmv-ota. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Fleet adoption is counted server-side**: `GET /admin/fleet` now reports
  `up_to_date` per product and account-wide, the devices at or past that
  product's newest release. A caller cannot derive this from `by_version`,
  which is keyed by version STRING (`"2.0.0"` against `"10.0.0"` is not a text
  comparison), so a dashboard would otherwise have to page every product and
  compare packed versions itself.
- **`measured` on `GET /admin/fleet`**, per product and account-wide: the
  devices adoption is measured over. A product with nothing published has no
  newest release to be behind of, so its devices sit outside the ratio rather
  than at 0% of it, and `measured` is the denominator that says so.
- **`totals` on `GET /admin/fleet`** (`client fleet --totals`): the account-wide
  counters alone, with an empty `products`. An overview reads four numbers, and
  an account with thousands of products should not be sent every product's
  version and cohort breakdown to render them.
- **`behind` / `up_to_date` on `GET /admin/devices`** (`--behind` /
  `--up-to-date`): the two halves of the fleet summary's adoption as device
  lists, each device measured against its OWN product's newest release.
  `older_than_release` could not express this -- it takes one release id, and a
  fleet spans products with separate version histories.
- **`seen_since` on `GET /admin/devices`** (`--seen-since` on `client device
  list`): the exact complement of `not_seen_since`, so "checked in since X" is
  one count from the server instead of a subtraction in a caller.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-16

The version the code reports moves off the `0.0.0` placeholder. No tag and no
GitHub release were cut: this entry records what the 1.0.0 line is, since the
number is user-visible in the API reference each deployment serves at `/docs`,
in `/healthz`, and in the `generated_by` field of every project lock file.

What that line contains, all of it shipped and covered by the suite (2079 tests,
enforced 100% coverage) and, for the update path, exercised on a nine-board
hardware fleet including the negative cases:

- **The project toolchain** — `project new` scaffolds a product, generates its
  key set, and pins the firmware it builds against; `build romfs`, `build
  firmware` and `build factory-romfs` produce the images; `flash factory`,
  `flash firmware` and `flash romfs` write them.
- **Signing that is not optional** — ECDSA over a key set you hold, with
  encrypted PEM as the floor and PKCS#11, AWS, GCP and Azure KMS backends for
  keys that never touch the build machine.
- **A device that comes back** — A/B slots, a trial an update must confirm,
  anti-rollback, and firmware-resident recovery for when no slot will boot.
- **The update server** — releases, cohorts, staged rollouts with auto-pause on
  failures, pins, delta artifacts built against what the fleet is running, a
  hash-chained audit log, and scoped tokens; every list endpoint sorts, filters
  and pages server-side and returns a filter-aware total.
- **Integrations** — capability grants for the live relay and the datalake, so
  a viewer or an ingesting device gets a short-lived token and nothing more.
- **Evidence** — CycloneDX SBOM per release with osv-scanner in CI, and the
  CRA / RED 3.3 alignment tables audited against the regulation's published text.
